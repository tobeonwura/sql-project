Customer Report
=============================================================================
Purpose:
	- This report consolidates key customer metrics and bahaviours

Highlights:
	1.	Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.
	2.	Segments customers into categoris (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.
	3.	Aggregates customer-level metrics:
		- total orders
		- total sales
		- total quantity purchased
		- total products
		- lifespan (in months)
	4.	Calculates valuable KPIs:
		- recency (months since last order)
		- average order value
		- average monthly spend
